# Modified Grey Wolf Optimization


## Features
- You can find GWO_epsilon inspired by Luo's paper in the optimizer directory.
- You can find GWO_modified in the optimizer directory, which includes restart, reflect and shift mechanism.
- Test function uses CEC2022 in default. You can change it to benchmarks.py by import benchmarks in optimizer.py.
